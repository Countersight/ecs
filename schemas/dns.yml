    DNS-specific event fields.This is NOT YET PART OF THE OFFICIAL ECS<br/>
    This schema has been taken from an open PR for DNS fields against the ECS 
    See https://github.com/elastic/ecs/pull/180 <br/>
    The ecs does not support boolean values, so in the interim, I'll change the booleans (flags) 
    to be keyword, where we can add 'true' or 'false'.
    I had to make a few modifications from the PR.
      - removed the phase entries
      - added a type to a bunch of entries that were missing types
      - removed all of the 'type: object' entries
  type: group
